Java implementation of Conway's Game of Life using Swing.

Because of the way the board is implemented, cellular automata may act innacurately when reaching the edges of the board. You can increase the cutout size used in the Board class, but this can impact performance.
For optimal performance, turn the grid off when going through iterations.

# TODO:
- Add different types of grids (hexagonal, triangular, etc)
- Add "heatmap" which can show the user the frequency of live cells on a given cell
