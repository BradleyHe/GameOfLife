Java implementation of Conway's Game of Life using Swing.
Because of the way the board is implemented, celluar automata may act innacurately when reaching the edges of the board. You can increase the cutout size used in the Board class, but this can impact performance.

# TODO (in order):
- Allow editing of game rules
- Optimize performance
- Add different types of grids (hexagonal, triangular, etc)
